# Game Programming Disciplines

1. AI

2. Gameplay 

**The gameplay programming creates the actual interactions that the lead designer has decided on.

4. UI

**The UI is the user interface where people can start the game, change the settings, and find information about the game. ** The UI also consists of the player's visual elements, such as a health bar, a stamina bar, and inventory slots. 

5. Rendering

7. Graphics

**2D graphics are some of the simpler forms of graphics, but the fact that they are simpler doesn't mean that they can't be complex. 3D graphics involve lighting and shadows that help create a more realistic environment. 

9. Multiplayers
